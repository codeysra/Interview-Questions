# Why Should I choose Java for Software Development Interview Questions

Because of the pros:
  o Supports multithreading and concurrency
  o Platform independent
  o Plenty of third part librairies for faster development
  o Memory management is automatic by use of garbage collector
  o Functional interfaces and lambda expressions make writting code easy and enjoyable. 
  

Some cons:
  o Is relatively slower than natively compiled languages like C and C++
  o Stop the world pauses problem:
    The automatic memory management may affect the application (by slowing it down). 
    This is because all other threads have to be stopped to allow the garbage collector thread to work.
